<!--Note:
1. For some corner cases, if you find some minor syntax errors after applying the automatic refactoring, you can fix them with manual editing--all the reported refactoring opportunities are refactorable.

2. If giving the custom names for the subclasses fails, try with the default names.

3. After applying the refactoring, if you wish to undo the refactoring, you can see the option "Undo SC/ST refactoring" under "Edit" in the menu.-->
